# Azondi

![An Azondi](resources/public/imgs/azondi1.jpg)

Azondi is a data digestion service. Azondi receives messages from the
individual devices and routes messages to relevant subscribers.  It
also serves data to UI clients over a WebSocket on port 8083.

The aim of Azondi is to provide an easy to use end to end service for
connected devices. More information on the architectural model can be
found in our
[blog](http://blog.opensensors.io/blog/2014/03/12/iot-in-the-city/).


## Project Maturity

Azondi is a **very young** project. Major changes in functionality
and implementation details should be expected.


## Components

### Messaging Broker 

Azondi has it's own built in [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker on top of
[Netty](https://github.com/OpenSensorsIO/azondi/blob/master/src/clojure/azondi/transports/mqtt.clj). Currently
the MQTT broker supports only QOS 0 level of service.

### Event Dispatcher

Azondi includes a non-blocking dispatcher of events. This dispatcher acts as a
kind of sorting office between devices and components that process them.

The dispatcher is [Reactor](http://reactor.github.io/reactor/) based.

### Databases

Azondi uses [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) to store events
and time series and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) to hand
user and device authentication.

## Usage
For convenience, it would be easiest to run azondi contained within a
Vagrant environment and there is a chef cookbook supplied for this. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSensorsIO/vagrant).

Once set up with vagrant, run lein repl and type (go).
