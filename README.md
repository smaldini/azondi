# azondi

Uses the [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) also known as asyncronous programming to process real time sensor data in clojure for [opensensors.io](http://opensensors.io).  We rely on clojure's core.async library heavily.

azondi takes a continous stream of messages from the test Mosquitto MQTT broker and creates an [MQTT bridge](https://github.com/OpenSensorsIO/azondi/blob/master/src/azondi/mqtt.clj). Using Server Side Events the data is pushed to the [browser](https://github.com/OpenSensorsIO/azondi/blob/master/src/azondi/core.clj).

Clojurescript builds the dataflow model on which processes the data in the browser.

## Incubated with Jig

Writing 'quick and dirty' Clojure back-ends is fun, simple and easy. When Clojure systems get larger, separation of concerns becomes a harder problem. We know we should do it (that's progress at least) but it's easier [said](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) than done.

Therefore, this project is incubated with [Jig](https://github.com/juxt/jig). Jig pushes a separation of concerns into configurable components, while retaining the rapid development environment Clojure developers are used to. Jig is designed to be optional at deployment time.

Further documentation on the azondi development workflow using JIG can be found [here](JIG.md)

## Usage

This is still an early version not quite read for production use.

We are using azondi to process sensor data on extremely large volumes and in a distributed manner.  It is still in development but we welcome any feedback.
