## About Us

opensensors.IO aims to simplify and lower the cost for running
Internet of Things projects. We process the real time and historical
city scale connected device data to build smart cities and environments.

When possible we encourage that communal data should be made available as real time and historical feeds with open data licenses. By encouraging the reuse of communal sensor data sets and making them easily accessible, we would like to encourage accelerated growth and a bottoms up design.

We aim to give you the tools to build the projects in the city space
and make it as easy as possible to get started.

If you would like to know more contact us on email at hello@opensensors.IO or check our blog for news about what we are up to, blog.opensensors.io
